# DSA Using Python

- **Data Structure**: A way of organizing and storing data so it can be accessed and modified efficiently. Examples include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.  
- **Algorithm**: A step-by-step procedure or set of rules to solve a problem or perform a computation. Algorithms define the logic behind operations like searching, sorting, and traversing data structures.

This repo covers **basic Python concepts** first, and then dives into the **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** part using Python.  
I’ve learned and practiced everything myself, organized it into structured files, and made it public here.  

✨ Hope it proves helpful to you!
